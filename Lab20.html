	<h2>Career Path</h2> 
		<p> I am an aspiring Java developer in training with an eagerness to learn and grow. I am self-motivated and resourceful, and I welcome all challenges as an opportunity for growth. </p>

	<h2>Hobbies</h2>
		<p> I enjoy taking long walks with my dogs in addition to bike riding with them. I also have a passion for yoga and try my best to make it a part of my daily routine. On the weekend, I love to relax on the lake with some of my family and close friends.</p>

	<h2>Hometown</h2>
		<p> I was born and raised in Commerce Township, Michigan. I lived in the same house my entire life, until I moved away to Michigan State University to study Psychology in 2011. After that, I moved to Fort Hood, TX, where my husband was stationed in Army. A few year later we moved back to Michigan and now currently live in Waterford.</p>
